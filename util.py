    Implements a priority queue data structure. Each inserted item
    has a priority associated with it and the client is usually interested
    in quick retrieval of the lowest-priority item in the queue. This
    data structure allows O(1) access to the lowest-priority item.

    Note that this PriorityQueue does not allow you to change the priority
    of an item.  However, you may insert the same item multiple times with
    different priorities.
